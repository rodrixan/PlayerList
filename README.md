# PlayerList

Simple app to show a list of sport players grouped by sport

## Features

* Minimum SDK: API 16
* MVP architecture with extra layer to deal with REST requests.
* AndroidAnnotations for linking and dependency injection instead of Dagger 2.
  * I've never worked with Dagger before, and this is a simple app.
  * Dagger 2 is more general than AndroidAnnotations for Android dependency Injection.
  * Dagger 2 is designed better for use with MVVM and LiveData/DataBinding Architecture.
* Retrofit 2 with Gson and OkHttp for parsing JSON
* Model generated by [JsonSchema2Pojo](http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/)
* Picasso for image url loading.
* Espresso Test to check list is correctly loaded.

## What it does

* The app loads a list of users in Manager from the following url: https://api.myjson.com/bins/66851
* Parse the data in Presenter and send it to View
* View populates an adaptder with the data and shows the users in an list.
  * The users are grouped by their sport
  * The list shows the sport in both the headers and the players.
